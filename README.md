Python ElasticSearch Practice
===

This is a python / flask program setup in a virtualenvironment.
It will be used to connect with an ES instance currently running on localhost:9100 (run controlled by repo vam_es_reactivesearch_test)

To Run
---

- To activate the virtualenv `source venv/bin/activate`
- If you are using .flaskenv you can start the server with `flask run`
- If you haven't set an environment variable you will need to run `export FLASK_APP=es_python.py` first.
